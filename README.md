The "Price Predictor ML" project is a Machine Learning endeavor aimed 
at creating an accurate model to estimate the prices of used cars. By 
employing regression models, the project showcases the practical 
application of machine learning in predictive tasks. 

The project includes a dataset and an IPython notebook file, which can
be executed to train and run the model. At the end of the process, a Tkinter 
Graphical User Interface (GUI) is displayed for interactive exploration. 
The project's objective is to develop a robust predictive model that utilizes 
selected features to provide reliable estimates for car prices. Detailed 
observations and findings can be found in the accompanying PDF file, providing 
insights into the model's performance and its potential real-world applications.
