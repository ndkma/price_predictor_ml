# price_predictor_ml
A price predictor using a machine learning algorithm and a dataset to predict used car price.

This is a Machine Learning project including a dataset and ipynb file. Running the ipynb file
trains and runs the model, and a tkinter gui is run at the end, just for fun. Observations can
be found in the pdf file.
